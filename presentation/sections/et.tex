  recursive, random training algorithm \cite{wiki:et} :
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item check stopping conditions
    % 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item no more features
    \item set is smaller than \code{minLeaf}
    \item all samples in the same class
    \end{itemize}
  \item choose \emph{random} feature. simply use the \emph{raw pixels as features} 
  \item find the mean and variance of this feature across the set. generate a random value from a \emph{normal distribution} with this mean and variance
  \item recur on the subsets obtained by splitting the parent set on the randomly chosen feature and threshold
  \end{enumerate}

  ensemble of random trees votes on test data to build extra-tree classifier
