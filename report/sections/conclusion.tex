In conclusion, we have shown that utilizing Decision Trees and Linear Discriminant Analysis on the Extended Yale Dataset B and MNIST datasets yields a favorable result. In the next part of this project, we will improve our classification accuracy and partake in a more thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space to optimize and generalize our classifiers.
