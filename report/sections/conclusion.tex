In conclusion, we have shown that utilizing Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Trees, and Extra-Trees on the Extended Yale Dataset B and MNIST datasets yields a favorable result. We have also shown the results of cross validation performed on our datasets with our algorithms and their hyperparameters. This served to generalize the performance of our classifiers.

For a demonstration of our functions, please navigate to the \code{code} folder and execute the functions given by \code{demonstration\_dt\_MNIST.m} and others, where \code{dt} stands for decision trees and \code{et} stands for extra-trees. These demonstrations illustrate the entire process of partitioning our data, training our classifiers, and calculating the results.
