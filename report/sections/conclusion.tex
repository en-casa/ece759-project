In conclusion, we have shown that utilizing Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Trees, and Extra-Trees on the Extended Yale Dataset B and MNIST datasets yields a favorable result. In the next part of this project, we will improve our classification accuracy and partake in a more thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space to optimize and generalize our classifiers. Additionally, we will develop a stand-alone demonstration of our algorithms' process from training to testing.
